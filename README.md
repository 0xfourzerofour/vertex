### Vertex GraphQL service proxy ### 

This Project is inspired by current pitfalls that I have come across at work with monolithic graphql schemas.
Vertex aims to solve this issue by allowing a single graphql endpoint to many downstream services by parsing 
the query body and matching the query to a service.
